# **Geospatial Programming Course Cohort-2**

This course is carefully designed to take you from zero coding knowledge to building professional geospatial projects—step by step, in your own language, Bengali. Whether you're a student, job seeker, or researcher, each class builds on the previous one to help you understand not just how to run code, but why it works.

We go beyond tutorials and give you the logic, tools, and portfolio to become confident in programming, Google Earth Engine (GEE), and geospatial analysis. Below is a detailed breakdown of what you'll learn in each class.
